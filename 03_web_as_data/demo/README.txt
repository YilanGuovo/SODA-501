Risk 1: lack of representativeness
Scraped data may overrepresent certain users or content while excluding others, limiting the generalizability. Researchers should acknowledge uncertainty about the sampling frame and representativeness, and develop deliberate sampling strategies to create random samples if possible. 
Risk 2: privacy concerns
It is difficult to get consent from users and some users' may not expect their data to be collected. Researchers should collect only the minimum data necessary for their research and have a well-documented process for securing data and protecting privacy.

5. Median citation counts were computed using observed years only. I just followed the codes in the in-class sample. Treating as zero would bias the median especially for faculty with shorter careers.
